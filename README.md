# Malware_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning
This project presents a performance prediction using the decision tree, random forest classifiers, and support vector machine as models to detect malware infection.This is a proactive approach to evaluating the capabilities of security systems in identifying and mitigating cyber threats.  

Using the confusion matrix for the evaluation of metrics such as true poitives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives, the models were trained to recognise patterns and anomalies associated with malware and thereby enhancing their ability to detect new and unknown threats.
